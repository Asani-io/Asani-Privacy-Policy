# Privacy Policy

## Introduction  
This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect at Asani, how we use it, and the choices you have regarding your data.

Asani built the **Asani Mobile App** as a free application for real-time data and user support, with optional premium subscription features. By choosing to use our Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

Unless otherwise defined here, terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our [Terms and Conditions](https://asani.io).

## Information We Collect and Use  
To enhance your experience, we may require you to provide personally identifiable information including, but not limited to:

- Full name  
- Email address  
- Location  
- Photos (for subscription verification)  

This information is retained and used to operate, improve, and secure the Service. Specifically, **we collect photo screenshots of your subscription payment screen to verify payments and prevent fraud**, and we collect **location details to facilitate accurate and timely delivery of tankers**.

The app may also integrate third-party services that collect information used to identify you. These third parties are bound by obligations of confidentiality and data protection.

## Cookies  
Cookies are small files stored on your device that often serve as anonymous unique identifiers.

While **we do not use cookies directly**, the app may use third-party code and libraries that do. You can choose to accept or refuse these cookies. Refusing cookies may limit some functionalities of the Service.

## Location Information  
The app may collect location data from your mobile device. This data is used **exclusively to provide location-based services**, such as delivering water tankers to your location, and for installing our devices after approval. We do not use this data for any unrelated purposes.

---

## Device Information  
We may collect device information to:

- Improve service performance  
- Ensure app compatibility  
- **Prevent fraudulent activity**

We do not collect data that directly identifies individual users unless required for specific features (e.g., payment verification).

## Subscriptions and In-App Purchases (for iOS Only)
The app offers optional premium features through auto-renewable subscriptions purchased via Apple’s In-App Purchase (IAP) system.

- Billing: Payments are charged to your Apple ID account at confirmation of purchase.
- Auto-Renewal: Subscriptions automatically renew unless canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current billing period.
- Management: You can manage or cancel subscriptions in your Apple ID account settings at any time.
- Refunds: Refunds are handled directly by Apple and subject to Apple’s policies. We do not process subscription cancellations or refunds ourselves.

We do not collect or store your payment information. Payment transactions are processed securely by Apple.

## Photos for Subscription Verification (for Android Only)
To protect against fraud, we collect and review screenshots or images of your subscription payment confirmation. This ensures that the services you access are valid and legitimately acquired.

- Billing: Users upload a screenshot or image of their payment confirmation after paying via their banking app or physically at the bank.
- Auto-Renewal: Subscriptions do not auto-renew on Android. Users need to manually make a payment each subscription period.
- Management: Users can contact us to manage or update their subscription.
- Refunds: Users can contact us for refund requests.

These images are used strictly for internal verification and are stored securely. We do not share them with third parties, unless required by law.

We may employ third-party companies and individuals for the following purposes:

- To facilitate our Service  
- To provide the Service on our behalf  
- To perform Service-related functions  
- To help us analyze how our Service is used  

These third parties may have access to your Personal Information solely to perform these tasks and are prohibited from using it for any other purpose.

## Security  
We value your trust and are committed to protecting your personal information. While we use commercially acceptable means to safeguard your data, no method of internet transmission or electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee absolute security.
